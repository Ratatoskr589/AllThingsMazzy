Ratatoskr and BCaesar's Multi-Mod: All Things Mazzy, Clara (Human Hexxat) NPC, Darkside Anomen, and more!
Version 3.08

Written, edited, and coded by BCaesar and Ratatoskr.

This mod is a collection of several projects, each of which would normally have its own thread and installation. However, it made far more sense for us to code them all together as one giant mod. So that's what we did.

A few notes:

1. This mod comes in several parts, some of which can be installed separately. There are more detailed notes about each section below. Most of the sections are optional in game, even if they are installed.

2. If you would like to use part of our code in another mod, please just ask us. The answer is probably yes.

3. The Beamdog forums are the best place to report bugs, make suggestions, or ask questions. It's also where you can see a more detailed breakdown of each section of the mod. 
      If you downloaded this mod from another location, the Beamdog thread is here: https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71473/megamod-2-45-mazzy-romance-clara-npc-darkside-anomen-flying-aerie-for-the-evil-more

4. Much thanks to p_zombie325 for the Russian translation, energisedcamel for the sound files, and Edvin for the new Mazzy art.


Here's what this mod includes:

Part 1: Main Installation

1) All Things Mazzy: Romance, Friendship and More! 
     This mod, as the title states, includes a Mazzy friendship, a romance, a way for her to join the Order of the Radiant Heart, numerous discussions between Mazzy and other NPCs, and many new interjections. To get the full Mazzy experience, you should install the optional For The Good component. Avoid this component if you want to be evil, since it adds many new chances for Mazzy to try to kill you. For a full list of everything in AllThingsMazzy, scroll to the end of this document.

2) Clara (Human Hexxat) NPC   (Now with an optional soundset)
    Exactly what it sounds like. We have reworked the end of the Hexxat intro quest so that you can kill Hexxat to keep Clara. She is a Neutral-Evil thief who can change her kit type at will. Although Clara starts out relatively weak, she levels up quickly and gains stats and abilities as she banters with other party NPCs. She has interjections throughout the game and three quests in SOA, one exclusive to For The Evil. You can also start a new TOB game and summon Clara to join you.

3) Darkside Anomen
     This is an expansion for Anomen if he fails his test. If you are romancing Anomen, you can take him down the most evil path to gain a Wisdom bonus and further dialogues. If you don't want to romance Anomen, then Clara will do it for you (Get both in your party and they'll start talking. This is optional).
     This also updates Anomen's sound files in SoA to match those in ToB once he fails his test, and fixes some interactions to reflect his darker path (for example, he no longer objects to Dorn attacking the Order). If you start a new ToB game, there is a dialogue that lets you choose Anomen's past. We also included a fix in the Anomen romance that allows him to make up with you if you accidentally rejected him.
     Darkside Anomen is basically complete.

4) Flying Aerie
    This is a mod for Aerie to get her wings back. There are three paths toward getting her wings back: the Regeneration route, the Edwin route, and the Spell-Store route. All three routes start in SoA and can be pursued simultaneously. They all finish in ToB. Like almost everything we write, you can pick up in ToB where you left off in SoA, so there is no need to stay in SoA in order to finish (or even start) this component. This option is also available for a brand-new ToB game and is complete.

5) Minsc-Neera-Boo Romance (SOA & TOB)
    Something that absolutely no one ever asked for, but you all secretly wanted: an optional romance between Neera, Minsc, and Boo! Written and coded because we can. If you aren't romancing Neera, Minsc will do it instead. This can start in SOA or TOB and is finished, including a wraith scene and epilogues.

6) Dorn-Haer'Dalis Romance (SOA & TOB)
      Another optional romance, because evil people need love too. This romance will begin in either SOA or TOB (continuing into TOB if you start it earlier) and includes a wraith scene, epilogues, an Aerie conflict, and lots of snarky comments on all sides. Not to mention the joy of Haer'Dalis and his florid poetry.

7) Jaheira-Wilson Romance (SoA)
       An optional romance between Jaheira and the secret NPC Wilson, that absolutely no one asked for and we wrote anyway. It will begin in SoA once you have both in your party, as long as the PC isn't romancing Jaheira. If you go to ToB before the romance finishes it will pick up where you left off in ToB. There are additional ToB dialogues provided the SoA part is finished before the Forest of Mir Wraith scene in ToB.

8) Other things in this installation:
- Expanded Mae'Var quest! You now have the option of returning the things you steal from the temples.
- A fix in the Underdark so drow bands won't attack you while you're disguised.
- A bugfix in the Copper Coronet so that you can actually get into the back with Lehtinan's permission. This allows you to side with the slavers or lie to infiltrate their operations.
- Bugfix for Minsc actually rejoining your party after being charmed by Irenicus' dryads.
- Additional drow massage options in Ust Natha.
- You can now sell the Cloak of Dragomir to Bodhi if you're working for her.
- If Dorn gives up his patron, he can pledge service to an evil god at their temple to regain his awesome powers. Check your local evil temple for details.
- An expansion for the Windspear Hills Quest to make the Order turn on you if you refuse Garren Windspear's help. 
- Re-added the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart to fight you if you attack the Order of the Radiant Heart (they exist in game, but the way they're coded most people will never see them).


Part 2: For the Evil (optional): 
     Additional mod options that may be off-putting to some good players. We write our evil characters as fairly awful people in the main mod and this explores them more in depth. However, this is actually less disruptive than For The Good to a normal game and we quite like how most of it turned out. These additions have nothing to do with Mazzy so you do not need to install them if you are only here for her.

1) Miscellaneous Evil Options For You:
         - An evil player option w/ the dryads in Irenicus' dungeon.
         - Minor evil options w/ Tiiro & Auvala, and Am Si (some of Tiiro and Auvala dialogues might require another mod to be installed).
         - Additional courtesan options in the Bridge District, Docks, & Brynnlaw
         - A more evil option with the dryad in the Windspear Hills
         - More immediate evil options with Adalon in Underdark
	 - If you have items that belonged to Drizzt's Party and the wizard Malchor Harpell tries to take them back, you can fight him instead of automatically giving up the items.
	 - You may sell the Dawn Ring to the Temple of Talos instead of returning it to the Temple of Lathander. 
	 - You may fight the elves in chapter 6 instead of doing what they demand.
	 - If you kill the Silver Dragon in the Underdark, you can now get Cromwell to make her scales into armor (the scales and armor already existed in ToB:EE).

2) Bodhi NPC- Now a fully functional NPC in SoA and ToB. Should be completely compatible with Ascension's Bodhi (the game treats them as completely different people). All good party members are incompatible with her and will object to her being in your party. She is also the enemy of Drizzt and the Order of the Radiant Heart. To get her in SoA you must work for her in Chapter 3, then defeat her and ask her to join you in Chapter 6. Bodhi is as complete as we're going to make her. She has lots of SoA interjections into the end-game, but not that many banters.

3) Bodhi-the-Elf NPC: At the end of SoA, should you direct Bodhi to accept Queen Ellesime's offer, Bodhi-the-Elf will ask to come with you. She is a Chaotic-Evil Elven monk. Good NPC's will again travel with her except for Mazzy, Anomen (if he's still with the Order), and Keldorn. Bodhi-the-Elf is a relatively quiet Easter-egg (much like the Wilson NPC was in BG2EE). 

3) Viconia in Ust Natha: Expanded quests and dialogues for Viconia when she's in the city of the drow. Taken to it's most evil conclusion, you can find yourself leading a demon and a small army of drow against the elves.

4) Korgan-Hexxat Friendship. 7 optional dialogues leading to a somewhat creepy friendship. Starts after their 1st banter. 

5) Sarevok-Viconia Relationship (Romance is too strong a term). 5 additional dialogues that start after their second banter.

6) Expanded Viconia-Hexxat Relationship. Triggers between their normal in-game banters. Four conversations. If you have a banter accelerator enabled, you'll probably need to travel/rest a lot to see them all since their final in-game banter ends the "relationship".

7) Viconia's Peace: A final quest for chapter 6/7 that builds off the Viconia-Clara banters. You must have defeated Bodhi and gotten the last Clara-Viconia NPC banter before this quest becomes available. We do not recommend starting this quest until you have finished everything you need to before the end-game... and that's all we're going to say about that.


Part 3: For the Good (optional):
     Additional mod options that might be annoying for a truly evil party. With these, Mazzy and other party members will no longer sit idly by while you do horrible things. This makes things more consistent with other good characters' reactions and we recommend installing it for the full Mazzy experience. However, if you plan to be evil and want Mazzy anyway, you should probably skip this part. For more details, look below.


Part 4: "Do NOT allow duplicate TOB epilogues" component (optional):
      If you install this, AllThingsMazzy epilogues will override the standard TOB epilogues and most mod epilogues. If you do not install this, you will get multiple epilogues where applicable. Either way, the AllThingsMazzy TOB epilogues should always play if triggered. 
      Please note that other mods may still overwrite the standard TOB epilogues regardless of this choice. Additionally, mods installed after ATM may cause duplicate epilogues since ours cannot be turned off the usual way. It's best to install this last if possible.


Part 5: "Soundset for Clara NPC" (Optional)
      This will install a basic soundset for the Clara NPC, including selection sounds, action sounds, and some other comments. It does not add voiced dialogue to her other talks. The voiced lines also do not match the text that will appear for Clara when you have subtitles turned on. This is not a bug.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Notes:
1) You will probably get the most out of this mod if you recruit Mazzy as soon as possible. That said, it is literally impossible to see the entire mod in one play-through since many conversations are mutually exclusive and the dialogue will change based on your companions. We built AllThingsMazzy with replayability in mind so we recommend leaving it installed whether you want to romance her or not. Also, we tend to write our evil characters as EVIL and Faerun isn't always nice. Please keep that in mind.

2)  A couple notes about the friendship/romance: 
	First of all, while some talks will trigger at specific points, this friendship/romance is primarily nonlinear. You can choose what you talk about and as long as you're not a total asshole or super evil, Mazzy will be your friend. You cannot break the friendship otherwise, though you can ask her to stop talking to you, and her tolerance for jokes will increase over time. There is a sense of humor beneath that stern exterior. If you break the friendship by accident, you will have one chance to get it back. 

	For the romance, there are no restrictions on race, gender, or class. As long as your charisma doesn't suck and you aren't illiterate, you will have a chance (male halflings will have the easiest time, but 12 CHA is the highest stat requirement). You must complete Mazzy's quest and bring her with you to rescue Imoen in order to begin her romance in Chapter 6.

     Romancing others will not stop you from romancing Mazzy, though for most romances, you will have to make a choice if you are already committed. It will be very clear when that moment comes and Mazzy generally won't care if you commit to another romance afterwards. Once the romance is active, you will have additional choices for your talks and depending on your choices, it can get semi-explicit. We don't have sex scenes per se but Mazzy is happy to discuss such things as frankly as you wish. The romance can be activated in TOB and an active romance can be continued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation and Compatibility:

This AllThingsMazzy mega-mod is installed like any other Weidu mod. Unzip it, put the AllThingsMazzy folder and set up file in your main game folder, and then run the set up.
    - We recommend installing the mod after major quest and NPC mods but before your tweaks. This will help crossmod NPC content work properly. See the "List of Mods with Crossmod Content" file for more details.
    - HOWEVER, if you plan to use the NPC Flirtpack or any romance mod that adds Player-Initiated Dialogues for existing NPCs, you should install those mods after AllThingsMazzy and any other banter/romance mods. We've done our best to account for PIDs in Mazzy, but they have a way of breaking other mods that are installed afterwards.
    - After the main mod installs, choose whether you want ForTheGood/ForTheEvil and duplicate TOB epilogues. These sections are not mutually exclusive.
    - To install a later version, uninstall the previous version and delete the AllThingsMazzy folder before installing the new version as usual.
    - We had to add scriptnames to three existing NPCs to make certain things trigger properly. This might cause issues with any other mods that do the same, but those are not common. If anyone wants a scriptname for Rose Bouquet, Gereth, BPROST1, DHARLOT1, or Bertrand the Companion, we'd be happy to share our code to aid compatibility.

Once installed, you shouldn't need to restart your game, though you may have already missed some interjections. We have put so much redundancy into our coding that you should be able to have a couple conversations, kick Mazzy out of your party, delete the mod, play half the game, get Mazzy back in your party, reinstall the mod, and have things pick up where they left off. You can break the game if you try, but we've done our best to make it difficult.

AllThingsMazzy should be compatible with most other mods. We've worked hard to make it foolproof since Ratatoskr has a LOT of mods installed. However, we cannot guarantee that our content will mesh with other mods in terms of NPC characterization/personality. We tend to write as though no other mods are installed since there's just too many to keep track of, and in some cases, we take existing NPC's in the opposite direction from what other mods chose to do.

In addition, we have tried to account for the following mods in our code, meaning that our rest scenes don't trigger concurrently and you may see different dialogue if you have those mods installed (for example, Imoen may have a different interjection if you have active romance):
	
1. Friendships/Banters: Viconia Friendship, the IEP Banter Project (as of March 25th, 2017). The other Mazzy Friendship shouldn't break our mod if you have both installed, but they don't mesh well thematically.
2. NPC Romances: De'Arnise Romance, Edwin Romance, Haer'Dalis Romance, Imoen Romance, Keldorn Romance, Sarevok Romance, and the Yoshimo Romance. (Plus all canon romances) (Thematic compatibility varies)
3. Miscellaneous Mods: Alternatives, Imoen4Ever, Saradas NPC (and about a dozen other NPCs with minor crossmod content), the Wilson Chronicles, NPC Strongholds

Version 3.08   ***Spoilers Below***   ***Spoilers Below*** 

Changes: 3.08

***This mod is no longer compatible with non-EE Baldur's Gate. Separating everything was getting in the way of our code. If you're really a die hard original Baldur's Gate user, message me and I can send you 1.071. That's the last version that might (and I mean might) work for you.

	Main Mod: 
		
        	1. Fixed a compatibility issue with the Dorn Romance mod and Dorn's patron quest. Hopefully fixed any solo issues with the patron quest on its own as well.

	- Mazzy now correctly attacks you if your reputation gets too low (it was coded but seemed to be bugged).
	- Other characters now choose sides (or stay out of it) if Mazzy and Player 1 fight. Every character should talk so if a canon one doesn't, it's a bug.
	- None of the options in CDTweaks to keep your NPCs from leaving will stop this from triggering. This is coded differently than the canon ones.
	- Mazzy will also attack if you do anything too evil during certain quests

O. Hexxat/Mazzy conflict (both SOA & TOB).
	- This includes a conflict both when you first get Hexxat involving most of your good characters and a Mazzy specific conflict if they are both in your party later. (If the conversation ends with Mazzy taking a couple people vampire hunting, try letting things play out).
  
P. Additional Mazzy Interjections

		2. Includes additions to Dorn's quest & romance interjections/options throughout.
                3. You will get the most content if they are committed before Spellhold, but it is not required.

	Main Mod: Clara
	       1. Clara can now change her thief kit. To do so, reform your party and remove her to trigger the dialogue. You may do this as often as you like.
               2. Additional interjections, including Tree of Life talk.
	       3. Added some crossmod compatibility for Clara's quests. Think of them as Easter Eggs.
               4. Hopefully fixed the Clara waiting timer so that it works properly.

        Main Mod: Misc.
		1. We had to add scriptnames to Bertrand, Rose, DHARLOT1, BPROST2, & Gereth to make certain quests work properly. To aid compatibility, we'd be happy to share our code with any other mod that also wants scriptnames for these NPCs.
                2. Added some code to make getting Wilson easier. Before you had to talk with him before releasing him, but most people didn't know that. Now he initiates dialogue with you automatically.
                3. A few additional options for Dorn's final SOA quest.
		4. Various bug fixes/corrections throughout the mod, as usual.

	For The Evil: Misc.
		1. Fixed an issue with our version of Malchor Harpell so it goes back to the default if you uninstall our mod after defeating him, instead of breaking your game.
                2. Clara-Viconia quest building off their banters. Triggers anytime post-Bodhi in chapters 6 or 7. Requires a couple of the Clara-Viconia banters to have triggered already. Includes new epilogues for Viconia.
                3. This quest includes some crossmod Easter Eggs, which will work best if ATM is installed after other NPC & expansion mods.

	For The Evil: Bodhi
		1. Added music to Bodhi's conversations.
                2. Additional interjections, including Tree of Life talk.
                3. Both versions of Bodhi now have TOB epilogues.

	For the Evil: Viconia and Sarevok
		1. Added Viconia's music to the conversations.

	For the Evil: Hexxat and Korgan
		1. Added Hexxat's music to the conversations. Also recoded some parts and changed a little dialogue.

	For the Evil: Hexxat and Viconia
		1. Fixed a bug where Viconia would accidentally kill Hexxat permanently and prevent her from coming back.

	For the Good: Misc
		1. Hopefully fixed a glitch w/ Ascension during the final TOB fight where Mazzy would attack you if Imoen became controlled by the enemy.

Version 2.45

Changes:

	A. Main Mod: All Things Mazzy:
		1. Adjusted the Korgan-Mazzy SOA talks so that the TOB banters are not turned off. This did remove a talk, technically, but should make things better overall.

	B. Main Mod: Clara
		1. Fixed an issue with Edwin's belt from their TOB banters. It still won't take effect until you leave inventory just like Clara's (that's due to a workaround that stops the game from crashing), but he will actually be able to use it.
                2. Created an NPC quest involving Clara and Rose Bouquet. The quest proper will begin once Aran is dead.

	C. Main Mod: Misc.
		1.Fixed a bug with the second Harlot Quest & made it more mod compatible as well.

	D. For The Evil:
		1. Adjusted all the harlot talks to be more compatible with other mods.
                2. Added a short Bodhi talk related to Clara's quest.

        E. For the Good:
               1. HaerDalis should now only join a Hostile Aerie if their NPC romance is complete. This was necessary for reasons.... 
               2. We've hopefully fixed a bunch of inconsistencies with Hostile Mazzy.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Version 2.42

Changes: 

	A. Main Mod: All Things Mazzy: Added an interjection (chapter 6 under the graveyard). Also a few bug fixes.

	B. Main Mod: Darkside Anomen
		1. If Anomen is doing the Fallen Paladin Quest after he has failed his test there was one interjection which did not fit. We removed it and added a new one.

	C. Main Mod: Misc.
		1. Added an expansion for the Windspear Hills Quest to make the Order turn on you if you forget Garren Windspear's help. You can now fight your way to peace should you wish to.
		2. Re-added the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart to fight you if you attack the Order of the Radiant Heart (they exist in game, but the way they're coded most people will never see them).

	D. For The Evil: Viconia in Ust Natha
		1. Updated AI scripts so your drow allies no longer remember old slights and fight each other.
		2. Added journal entries to help guide you.
		3. Added a fix so you can now leave the battle before you defeat the Elven leaders and still have the story progress.
		4. Added some bug fixes.

	E. For The Evil: Bodhi NPC
		1. Added Bodhi NPC to SoA! 
			A. You will only have the option to gain Bodhi if you worked for her in Chapter 3.
			B. As in ToB, Bodhi is incompatible with all good or druid NPC's in BG2:EE. She is also the enemy of Drizzt and the Order of the Radiant Heart.
			C. Similar to ToB, Bodhi is an over-powered killing machine, but her claws tend to make enemies explode meaning you cannot loot their items (except for quest items).
			D. If you sold the Cloak of Dragomir to Bodhi in Chapter 3, she will have it in her inventory when she joins you. This allows her or Hexxat to walk in sunlight but lowers their stats while they wear it.
			E. Added many dialogues and interjections for her in chapters 6 and 7.
		2. Added Bodhi-the-Elf NPC to ToB. At the end of SoA, should you direct Bodhi to accept Queen Ellesime's offer, Bodhi-the-Elf will ask to come with you. She is a Chaotic-Evil Elven Monk. Good NPC's will again travel with her except for Mazzy, Anomen (if he's still with the Order), and Keldorn. 

	F. As always we fixed many additional typos and bug fixes as we found them. Many thanks to everyone who reports errors on the Beamdog forum thread.

		1. Added a series of dialogues and a couple of quests involving Viconia in Ust'Natha, which if taken to their most evil conclusion will involve you at the head of a small army of drow with a demon at your side.
		2. Added dialogues causing all the good party members to object to Bodhi being in your party.
		3. If you kill the Silver Dragon in the Underdark you can now get Cromwell to make her scales into armor (the scales and armor already existed in ToB:EE).
 		4. You now have a couple of options to fight the elves outside the Underdark in Chapter six if you choose the most hostile dialogue options.

        C. For the Good:
                1. Hostile Mazzy will now trigger if you attack the temple of Helm or Lathander in the Temple District, or the Radiant Heart.
